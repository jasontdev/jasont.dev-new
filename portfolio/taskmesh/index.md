# taskmesh.xyz (WIP)
## Introduction
taskmesh is a multi-user task management system for teams. It utilises a Java/Spring Boot backend, MySQL database and React front-end. I am aiming
to achieve a product-grade user experience. I have chosen to use technologies that are not the most exotic or cutting-edge but that will allow me
to acheive the best result with the highest level of productivity. The app will be deployed to Azure with the front-end running on Azure Static Web Apps
and the backend running on an Azure Virtual Machine.
