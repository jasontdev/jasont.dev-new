title: "Obligatory Todo"
description: "My first completed React project. Uses create-react-app, Styled Components, Firebase for auth, persistene and hosting. I can't say
the end result is too flash but I learnt a lot in the process. There's an awful lot I've learnt since so I wouldn't actually mind
picking this one up again and giving it a bit of a revamp."
